for this game i wanted to emulate a simlar game that is popular across the internet and on mobile devices. 
the objective is to go through the circle at the point that it is that same color as the player (knob). the score increases
every time you reach the next marker (colorChanger) which is represented by a clone of the player but in white and after the objective. 
it is an infinite single level game that has the objective of getting the highest score. I had an issue trying to create a instanitatior loop
that would continue to replicate the circles. insteade i manually recreated the circles and color changer objectives which would not be sustainable in the 
long term.
